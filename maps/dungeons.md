######     ~You put your robe and wizard hat on. You are still in a dungeon.~


Expand into the depths for treasure.\nEverytime a new room is discovered, the depth-meter in your left top will increase.\n\nEnemies get more chonky.\nResources yield more ore.\nLoot gets more shiny.\n\nYou can use the green smelly dungeon sewers for long range transports.\n\nHow far can you make it?
