The biters have catched the scent of fish in the market.\nFend them off as long as possible!\nThis however will not be an easy task,\nsince their strength and resistance increases constantly over time.\n\nYour ultimate goal is to evacuate all the fish to cat planet!\nPut them in your rocket's cargo and launch them into space.\nDon't worry, you will still get space science.\n\nThe Market will gladly take any coin you might find.\nAdditional turret slots can be bought at the market.\nSeveral unique upgrades are available too.\nResearching tanks will unlock the artillery technology early.\nAny container bearing dangerous goods, like ammo, grenades or barrels,\ncauses heavy explosions when it breaks.\nMaybe this can be used to our advantage.
