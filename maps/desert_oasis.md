##### --Desert Oasis--

###### Survival in the dry sands.


This is a harsh world, the heat is unbearable and the sand is sharp like diamonds.\nMake sure to stay properly hydrated.\nDrink some water from a pond, or sip it out of a barrel to stay refreshed.\n\nWe shall not attempt to travel without a proper vehicle.\nMany building foundations are not possible to be set up outside of the oasis.\nRailways between them however should be possible.\n\nLuckily the ship's moisture meter module did survive the crash.\nIt may come in handy!
