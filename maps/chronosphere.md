######     ..Comfylatron gone wild..


Comfylatron has seized the Fish Train and turned it into a time machine.\n Your job as his slave is:\n\n[1] Keep train alive at all costs.\n[2] Gather resources while travelling through different locations.\n[3a] Press enter on cargo wagons to enter the insides of train.\n[3b] Press enter on cars to exit the train.\n[4] Charging the accumulators inside the train speeds up the jump, but creates HUGE pollution, aggravating the biters.\n[5] Items inserted into the blue chests get teleported into the train.\n[6] Some planets are poor, some are rich, and some are just too dangerous.\n\nLoot, but also evolution, grows with jumps performed.\n During jump, personnel and their inventories will be teleported in, but anything left behind outside won't.\nEarly jumps award 25 coins per minute spared (until the 25th jump).\nObtaining mining productivity research grants inventory space and hand-mining speed.\n\nGood luck. Don't let biters ruin the show!
