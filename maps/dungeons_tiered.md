######     ~You put your robe and wizard hat on. You are still in a dungeon.~


Expand into the depths for treasure.\nEverytime a new room is discovered, the depth-meter in your left top will increase.\n\nEnemies get more chonky.\nResources yield more ore.\nLoot gets more shiny.\n\nBut for real challenge and real shinies, you need to go also deeper.\nUse arrow buttons on top to change floors!\n\nHow far can you make it?
