## Using Comfy maps

1. Download the latest release that we have published: <a href="https://github.com/M3wM3w/ComfyFactorio/tags">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/tag/M3wM3w/ComfyFactorio.svg?label=Release" alt="Release">
  </a>

2. Thereafter, unzip the folder to your desktop and move the extracted folder to: ``%appdata%\Factorio\Scenarios\``.

3. After that is done, open ``control.lua`` which can be found inside the ``%appdata%\Factorio\Scenarios\'extracted-map'\control.lua``. 
4. Find the line ``---- enable maps here ----`` and remove the ``--`` in front of the map that you want to activate. Make sure only 1 map is activated.
5. Save the file.
6. Open Factorio and press ``>> Play >> Scenarios``
